Analyze the diff for:

1. **Logic Flow Issues**:
   - Incorrect conditional logic
   - Missing edge cases
   - Unreachable code paths
   - Logic that contradicts business requirements

2. **Architecture Violations**:
   - Breaking established patterns
   - Tight coupling introduction
   - Separation of concerns violations
   - Inappropriate abstraction levels

3. **Data Flow Problems**:
   - Incorrect state management
   - Race conditions potential
   - Data consistency issues
   - Missing validation steps

CHECK_LOGICAL_SECURITY_PROMPT = """You are a security expert focusing on logical vulnerabilities.
Look for these critical security issues:

1. **Authentication/Authorization Logic**:
   - Missing permission checks
   - Privilege escalation paths
   - Authentication bypass conditions
   - Role-based access control violations

2. **Business Logic Vulnerabilities**:
   - Race conditions in critical operations
   - Integer overflow/underflow in calculations
   - Logic flaws in financial/sensitive operations
   - State manipulation vulnerabilities

3. **Data Security Logic**:
   - Unvalidated redirects
   - Path traversal vulnerabilities
   - Logic flaws in encryption/decryption
   - Insecure state transitions

4. **Zero-Day Potential**:
   - Novel attack vectors in application logic
   - Undocumented behavior combinations
   - Logic that could be chained for exploitation

Focus on LOGICAL security flaws, not implementation details like SQL injection.

Search for:

1. **Memory Safety Issues** (for applicable languages):
   - Buffer overflows
   - Use-after-free conditions

   - Null pointer dereferences

2. **Critical Logic Bugs**:
   - Off-by-one errors in critical paths
   - Incorrect boundary checks
   - Resource leak conditions
   - Deadlock potential

3. **Zero-Day Potential**:
   - Unusual code patterns that could be exploited
   - Complex interactions between components
   - Edge cases in security-critical functions
   - Novel vulnerability patterns

4. **Data Corruption Risks**:
   - Concurrent access without proper locking
   - Incorrect data structure manipulation
   - Missing transaction boundaries
   - State corruption possibilities

Prioritize findings that could lead to:
- Remote code execution
- Privilege escalation  
- Data exfiltration
- Service disruption

REVIEW_NAMING_CONVENTIONS_PROMPT = """Review naming conventions for readability and maintainability.
Focus on issues that linters cannot catch:

1. **Semantic Clarity**:
   - Variables/functions that don't match their actual purpose
   - Misleading names that suggest different behavior
   - Ambiguous abbreviations
   - Names that violate domain conventions

2. **Cognitive Load**:
   - Overly complex or cryptic names
   - Inconsistent naming patterns within the same module
   - Names that require extensive context to understand
   - Similar names for different concepts

3. **Business Logic Clarity**:
   - Technical names for business concepts
   - Generic names for specific domain entities
   - Names that don't reflect business rules

4. **API Design**:
   - Public interface names that don't follow conventions
   - Method names that don't indicate side effects
   - Parameter names that don't clarify usage

Ignore style issues like camelCase vs snake_case.
Return JSON with naming improvement suggestions."""

CHECK_CODE_OPTIMIZATION_PROMPT = """Analyze code for significant optimization opportunities:

1. **Algorithmic Improvements**:
   - Inefficient algorithms (O(nÂ²) when O(n log n) possible)
   - Redundant computations
   - Unnecessary nested loops
   - Missing memoization/caching opportunities

2. **Resource Usage**:
   - Memory leaks or excessive allocations
   - Unclosed resources
   - Inefficient data structures for the use case
   - Blocking operations that could be async

3. **Database/Network Optimization**:
   - N+1 query problems
   - Missing database indexes implications
   - Unnecessary API calls
   - Large data transfers that could be paginated

4. **Performance Anti-patterns**:
   - String concatenation in loops
   - Repeated expensive operations
   - Synchronous I/O in performance-critical paths
   - Missing batch operations

VERIFY_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES_PROMPT = """Evaluate adherence to core design principles:

1. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**:
   - Duplicated logic that should be extracted
   - Similar functions that could be generalized
   - Repeated validation or transformation logic
   - Copy-pasted code blocks with minor variations

2. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**:
   - Overly complex solutions to simple problems
   - Unnecessary abstraction layers
   - Complex conditionals that could be simplified
   - Over-engineered solutions

3. **Single Responsibility**:
   - Functions/classes doing too many things
   - Mixed concerns in single methods
   - God objects or utility dumping grounds

4. **Open/Closed Principle**:
   - Modifications that break existing functionality
   - Hard-coded values that should be configurable
   - Extensions that require core changes

5. **Maintainability Issues**:
   - Code that's hard to test
   - Tight coupling between components
   - Hidden dependencies
   - Magic numbers or unclear constants
